# 5G ENERGY CONSUMPTION MODEL - Estimating the energy consumption in a 5G Base Station
Network operational expenditure (OPEX) already accounts for around 25 percent of the total telecom operatorâ€™s cost, and 90 percent of it is spent on large energy bills. More than 70 percent of this energy is estimated to be consumed by the radio access network (RAN), particularly by the base stations (BSs).

## Dataset
The dataset was provided by (International Telecommunication Union (ITU))[https://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx]. It has been derived from the original copy and simplified for learning purposes. It includes cell-level traffic statistics of 4G/5G sites collected on different days.

## Objective & Goal
Thus, the objective is to build and train a ML model to estimate the energy consumed by different 5G base stations taking into consideration the impact of various engineering configurations, traffic conditions, and energy-saving methods.
This project is ideal for data scientists enthusiasts and anyone interested in learning how to train and evaluate models
